### Credit Card default risk 

**Objective:-** To come up with an ML Model to determine whether companies or individuals would be able to return the money lent on time.


### Approach 

- First encoding the categorical columns ['gender','owns_car','owns_house']
    - binary encoded (0 or  1)
- column ['occupation_type'] contains categorical data (16 unique values)
    - encoded with value 0 to 16 based on position ,e.x :'Laborers' to 2 and 'Drivers' to 4
- columns ['migrant_worker','prev_defaults','default_in_last_6_month'] are already binary values (0,1)

- Missing values filled with mode and mean of that cols for categorical and continues columns respectively
    - ['no_of_children','total_family_members','migrant_worker'] ==> mode() for missing values
    - ['no_of_days_employed','yearly_debt_payments','credit_score'] ==> mean() for missing values for respective column

- handeling Imbalance dataset
    - dataset was highly imbalanced (ratio of 0/1 was very big)
    - used Imblearn's oversampling (SMOTE) to create a balance dataset
        - original shape ~(41k) , new size ~(83k)

- **dataset of this stage is kept as (x_train,y_train) --> phase1**

- Used Standardization to scale each column (expect target col) to bring mean to 0 and standard deviation to 1 for that column
    - used StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing

- **dataset at this stage is kept as (x_train_scaled,y_train) ---> phase2**

- Applied PCA technique to reduce dimensions from 16 to 12 .
    - used PCA from sklearn.decomposition
    - used a iterative while loop to see how many columns can be reduced to retain 95% of variance , using covariance matrix of generated by PCA

- **dataset at this stage is kept as (x_train_scaled_pca,y_train) ---> phase3**

- y_train remains the same as it contins only targets (dependent variable)

- uses the same instances used while train datset to preprocess the test data(test.csv)
    - instances like , StandardScaler , PCA()
    - created 3 different test dataframe
        - test_x , test_x_scaled, test_x_scaled_pca ( just like training phase)


### Testing of different ML classifier trai datasets:

- Used Kfold and cross validation score and tried running training dataset on 5 different classifier,
given next to them are the avg. f1 score from cross_val_score()

    - normal raw dataset (phase1 dataset)
        - Logistic Regression : 0.9378
        - KNeighborsClassifier : 0.8301
        - LinearSVC : 0.7213
        - Random forest : 0.9874
        - XGBoost : 0.9807

    - scaled dataset (phase2 dataset)
        - Logistic Regression : 0.9688
        - KNeighborsClassifier : 0.9704
        - LinearSVC : 0.9692
        - Random forest : 0.9874
        - XGBoost : 0.9810
    
    - (scaled + pca) dataset (phase3 dataset)
        - Logistic Regression : 0.9689
        - KNeighborsClassifier : 0.9703
        - LinearSVC : 0.9692
        - Random forest : 0.9810
        - XGBoost : 0.9721
